# Pac-Man Example

This is an example on how to make a (mostly) accurate Pac-Manlike Maze Game. All the information on the mechanics was engineered by reading the information contained within [The Pac-Man Dossier](https://pacman.holenet.info/). This example was made for both Godot Engine 4.3 Mono and Redot Engine 4.3 Mono.

### To Do:
Update program code with detailed comments to show users what does what. It's pretty barebones at the moment.

### Features:
- Complete Pac-Man game loop. Sans the title screen and intermissions.
- Complete and accurate Ghost AI.
- Scoring system.
- 2 player support (Change players value in Master.cs to 1 or 2 respectively).

### Controls:
Arrows - Movement
